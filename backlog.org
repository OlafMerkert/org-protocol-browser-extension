As a user, I do not want to have to manually switch focus to Emacs. Moreover, the action popup should close automatically.
*** DONE close popup
*** DONE research focus change request
seems not to be possible
** DONE automatic detection of capture type
As a user, I would like pull requests and JIRA tasks automatically trigger the correct capture target. 

For now, there should be another button labelled "Automatic capture".

+ TFS Pull request (template key R): [[http://someserver:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/someProject/someTeam/_git/someRepo/pullrequest/2134#_a=overview]]

+ JIRA task on board:
  [[https://jira.somewhere.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=100&view=detail&selectedIssue=TM-3479]]
  For a selected issue, the link should point to the issue page.
  The title will not have relevant information.
  
+ JIRA issue (template key J):
  https://jira.somewhere.com/browse/TM-3479

+ As fallback, we should use the normal capture option without predefined template key
*** DONE add buttons for capturing JIRA and PR manually
*** DONE detect pull request
*** DONE detect JIRA issue
*** DONE detect JIRA task on board
*** DONE add button for automatic capture
** DONE organised menu with org tasks
As a user, I only need the most frequently used actions accessible with one click. Less frequently used actions should be collected in a menu.

Frequent actions are:
+ automatic capture
+ store link

Additional actions should include:
+ capture
+ copy selection
+ send email
+ open in eww
+ capture JIRA task
+ capture pull request
*** DONE smaller component for other actions
+ smaller rectangular button
*** DONE larger component for frequent actions
+ large square button
*** DONE polish styles
** DONE Keyboard shortcuts
As a power user, I would like to invoke org-capture and other org tasks with a custom keyboard shortcut.

** CANCELLED buttons in toolbar
As a user, I would like to access the org-capture functionality from a toolbar.
*** DONE research toolbar api
webextension api does not provide this currently. see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1215064
*** TODO add custom toolbar with dummy button
*** TODO wire button to capture function
** automatic capture for appointments from zimbra and outlook
As a user, I want to conveniently copy appointments from Zimbra to org.

Should this even use browser capture?
