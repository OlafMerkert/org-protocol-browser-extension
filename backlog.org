#+TODO: REFINE TODO IN-PROGRESS DONE

* Stories
** IN-PROGRESS working general capture
As a user, I want to invoke org-capture by clicking a button.
** REFINE buttons in toolbar
As a user, I would like to access the org-capture functionality from a toolbar.
** automatic detection of capture type
As a user, I would like pull requests and JIRA tasks automatically trigger the correct capture target
** other actions beside capture
As a user, I want to
+ store links
+ copy the current selection
+ send a e-mail with a link of the current page
+ open a page in the emacs browser
** organised menu with org tasks
As a user, I only need the most frequently used actions accessible with one click. Less frequently used actions should be collected in a menu.
** Keyboard shortcuts
As a power user, I would like to invoke org-capture and other org tasks with a custom keyboard shortcut.
