* Org Protocol Browser Extension
** About
Firefox has for some time been blocking simple bookmarklets for invoking org-protocol on sites with strict CSP settings. The browser extension brings help by providing shortcuts and action buttons to replace these particular bookmarklets.

This browser extension is currently targeted at Firefox and Chrome.
** Build it
Install [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node.js]] with the npm package manager. In the main repository directory, run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
> npm install
> npm build
> npm run package
#+END_SRC
** Run it
+ In development mode for Firefox: go to [[about:debugging]] and temporary load the extension by selecting the zip file created in the target directory by the build.
+ In development mode for Chrome: got to [[chrome://extensions]] and load the extension by selecting the ~target/dist~ folder.
