* Org Protocol Browser Extension
** About
Firefox has for some time been blocking simple bookmarklets for invoking org-protocol on sites with strict CSP settings. The browser extension brings help by providing shortcuts and action buttons to replace these particular bookmarklets.

This browser extension is currently targeted at Firefox and Chrome.
** Build it
Install [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node.js]] and the [[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/][Yarn]] package manager. In the main repository directory, run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
> yarn
> yarn build
> yarn package
#+END_SRC
** Run it
+ In development mode for Firefox: go to [[about:debugging]] and temporary load the extension by selecting the zip file created in the target directory by the build.
+ In development mode for Chrome: got to [[chrome://extensions]] and load the extension by selecting the ~target/dist~ folder.

Note that some handlers are custom defined in my emacs configuration and may not be available in every configuration.
*** Capture template based on page url
The automatic capture command applies some simple heuristics to the urls and automatically selects a capture template for the following:
+ pull request on Team Foundation Server
+ issue page on JIRA
+ selected issue on a JIRA board, it will also try to generate a link to the issue page
*** Keybindings
